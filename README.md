# RainSweeper

Galway RainSweeper is something like Minesweeper except instead of mines there are rainy days and instead of flags there are umbrellas. The game uses real Met Ã‰ireann data taken from Athenry weather station. Get the app to play the 24 other weather stations.

You get three spare umbrellas for every game, these open automatically if you choose a rainy day.

You can add/remove your own umbrellas by right clicking or pressing spacebar. The more rounds you clear the more spare umbrellas you can collect.
