### About

RainSweeper is a game something like Minesweeper except instead of mines there are rainy days and instead of flags there are umbrellas. 

The website is built with Gatsby.js. It is playable with mouse or keyboard. It uses real Met Ã‰ireann data taken from Athenry weather station via [met-eireann-api](https://github.com/agfoghlaim/met-eireann-api). There is also an [app version](https://github.com/agfoghlaim/rain-sweeper-app) to play the 24 other Irish weather stations.


## The Game

You get three spare umbrellas for every game, these open automatically if you choose a rainy day.

You can add/remove your own umbrellas by right clicking or pressing spacebar. The more rounds you clear the more spare umbrellas you can collect.
